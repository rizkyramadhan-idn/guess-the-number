# Guess The Number

This is a single player version of a game I used to play in high school. The rules are simple but it is quite challenging, especially for higher digits.

## Development

1. Clone this repo and get into the directory
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. Start your browser, go to localhost:8080
5. Start developing

## Building

1. `npm run build`
2. The built files is inside public directory

## Additional Notes

- Built with service worker so it can be played offline
- There is a plan for multiplayer mode, if I can get myself to build the server part
